Un inspecting them, I realized that one of the chargers was not working correctly for 1/7 laptops. I immediately reached a request.Usually, I get a replacement option, but in this scenario, the only available option was a service request. An engineer was scheduled to visit on fifth of November. The engineer did not visit on the fifth or sixth. On seventh, I raised another complain that there was no visit. The team assured me that this is a technical glitch and that the engineer will visit soon, but it is not reflecting on their system.Finally, I called up on 17th of Nov. The Executive said that I will call you post 8 PM after talking to the concerned department. She called up at 8:35 PM and informed that there is no resolution yet and she will call tomorrow. No call on 18th at all.Eventually, on 19th I called, got transferred three times and eventually Snigdha informed me that ""You are too late. The service window has closed.

One agent ""assured"" me they would call back with the refund. This was a lie.• Rude & Dismissive Staff: One agent was rude. Another put me on hold for 15 minutes and hung up.• Wasted Time: Today, I was put on a 17-minute hold, only to be abruptly told ""no refund,"" contradicting all previous promises.I have been lied to, had my time wasted, and been treated with zero respect after losing ₹70,000.

I have explained all these to the Amazon Indian customer service, but they don't seem to care. I believe that it's my right to raise this concern. I spent money but did not get the same number of items. The investigation says that the item was not damaged and the correct item was received, but as a buyer I have the right to proof that I haven't  received the same number of item as advertised.

Trustpilot,"Dear Amazon Team,","Dear Amazon Team,I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with your service. This has been one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had with any company. Despite raising multiple complaints and calling your team more than 10 times, my issue is still unresolved. Your investigation team keeps saying “this is the final resolution”, but may I ask — what kind of final resolution is this when you haven’t even provided me with a proper answer or refund?I have called your customer service team on 3 Oct, 13 Oct, 19 Oct, 30 Oct, 6 Nov, 12 Nov, 13 Nov, and even today. Every time I’m promised a solution, but nothing actually happens. My return pickup was never done properly, and yet your team keeps blaming me instead of fixing the issue. This is completely unacceptable.To make matters worse, one of your representatives spoke to me in an extremely unprofessional and rude manner. It’s shocking that a company like Amazon would allow customer service agents who don’t even know how to talk to customers politely.Your investigation team is handling this matter carelessly. When I requested the proof or report of the investigation, your team refused, giving excuses like “security reasons.” This is not transparency — this is hiding your mistakes and trying to put the blame on customers.I am asking again — if your team claims that I denied the pickup, please show me proof of when, where, and to whom I supposedly denied it. I have every right to see the evidence.Because of your negligence, my money is still stuck, my product is uncollected, and my time has been completely wasted. If this issue is not resolved immediately, I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter to the Consumer Court and share this entire experience publicly.Please process my refund immediately and take strict action against the unprofessional behavior of your customer support and investigation teams.This whole experience has been mentally exhausting, time-wasting, and deeply frustrating. I expect a clear, written response with the proof and an update on my refund status without any further delays.Sincerely,Harshita Order id 406-1639193-4305904",,2025-11-13T18:17:08.000Z
Trustpilot,The Customer service make the false promises.,"I was promised a refund within four hours, yet it has now been over two weeks and I still haven’t received it. The issue was supposedly escalated to a manager, but even then, no refund was processed despite what the original agent assured me on chat.During this time, my chat was transferred between four different agents, none of whom provided any resolution. To make things worse, the TL/manager suddenly closed the chat from their side in the middle of the conversation. After that, I was unable to reconnect with a live agent about the same issue and kept getting pushed to the bot instead. There was no apology, no acknowledgment of the inconvenience, and not even an offer of store credit.I have never seen such an unprofessional customer service team. And saying this in India is a big deal because we already don’t expect very high service standards, but this experience was far worse than anything I’ve encountered.What made the situation even more disappointing is that a US-based agent was able to send me the chat transcript via email without any issue, while the India-based agents treated the situation completely differently. It genuinely felt like customers are handled one way in “first-world” regions and another way elsewhere.They seem fine as long as everything goes smoothly. But the moment you have a problem, the support team keeps transferring the chat instead of helping, and you get stuck with bots instead of actual assistance.I truly hope this review reaches someone who can bring real improvements to their customer service team.Order # 404-9587975-0221130",,2025-11-11T20:30:33.000Z

Order ID: 403-0390048-4590738 (Placed on 27th August)Delivery date was 28th August, but the product never arrived. Still, the status showed “Delivered.”There was no customer care number available on the website or app to contact directly. The only option was to raise a query, which I did continuously for 4 days with zero resolution. After 4 days, finally, a customer care contact option appeared and only then my refund was processed.Order ID: 403-4148856-9701166 (Placed on 1st September)Delivery date was shown as 2nd September → Not delivered.Rescheduled to 3rd September → Again not delivered.Now it shows 4th September. How long should a Prime Member keep waiting?This is unacceptable and frustrating. I paid for Prime Membership to get fast and reliable delivery, but instead, it has only wasted my time, money, and trust.Questions to Amazon:Why is “Delivered” being shown when no product is received?Why is there no direct and accessible customer care number?Why are Prime members facing such repeated delivery failures?If this continues, I will have no choice but to escalate this issue publicly across social media and consumer forums. I expect Amazon to take immediate action and ensure such harassment does not happen again.",,2025-09-03T20:21:32.000Z

Trustpilot,🚨 Repeated Delivery Failures by Amazon…,"As a long-time Amazon customer, I’ve faced recurring issues where orders are either returned to the seller or marked undelivered — without any call, message, or update from the delivery agent.I’ve raised several complaints over the past months. While a few orders get delivered properly after escalation, the issue keeps coming back. There’s no permanent resolution or accountability from Amazon's side.This not only causes inconvenience but also reflects poorly on customer service and delivery management.I hope someone from @Amazon India or higher management genuinely looks into this recurring problem and addresses it for good.#AmazonIndia #CustomerExperience #DeliveryIssues #AmazonSupport #EcommerceReliability",,2025-08-01T14:38:28.000Z
Trustpilot,Issues with Amazon Customer Service:,"Issues with Amazon Customer Service:1. Just like how there is an easy simple button to ""Buy now"" or ""Add to cart"", why isnt there a simple button next to the orders to contact the Customer Service? Why do we have to go all the way to Help, and have to request a call back, then need to select multiple automated selections, just to finally have a human being to talk to, about the issue with your order? I know, yes, I know this is intentional. Bet Amazon will rather go to the grave than to correct this.2. Cant Amazon put people who are quite fluent with the regional language, or atleast in English? You get what you pay for. Is it wrong when consumers ask that? Pay less to empoyees, recruit cheap labour, dont give them enough training, the end  result will be your average Amazon customer service agent.

I raised a return request and was told to self-courier the item back.Accordingly, I shipped the item through DTDC on 26th June, and it was delivered to the seller by 30th June, as confirmed by the tracking.However, when I contacted Amazon support on 26th July, they refused to process the refund, saying the courier receipt is “invalid.” This is beyond unreasonable, considering the shipment was successfully delivered and proof was already submitted.To make matters worse, the customer service executive cut the call mid-conversation, which shows a complete lack of professionalism and customer respect.Why should a genuine customer suffer even after following all the steps correctly? If Amazon asks for self-shipping, they must honor valid courier receipts and tracking. This has been a frustrating and disappointing experience.Amazon seriously needs to improve how they treat honest customers and handle return cases more responsibly.",,2025-07-26T10:04:46.000Z

Trustpilot,"Star – PATHETIC SERVICE | ₹70,000 LOST | AMAZON FRAUDING ME","This is not just a review — it’s a WARNING to every Prime customer who thinks Amazon values loyalty or premium purchases. They don’t.I ordered an Apple iPhone 15 (256 GB, Pink) worth ₹69,500 on June 9, 2025, from Clicktech Retail Pvt. Ltd. on Amazon India. The phone started overheating within 4 days. I immediately contacted Amazon to report a defective product and requested a return.Instead of helping, they pushed me to visit the Apple Service Center, where the device was officially declared DEFECTIVE. I submitted the required denial letter as per Amazon's policy.But since then, everything has been a scam:I have spoken to 25+ customer care agents and 25+ technical staff — all of them gave me false promises.Repeated pickup promises FAILED. Not once did they pick up the item.I had to spend ₹2,500 out of my own pocket to courier the product to the delivery address because I no longer live there.Every single day, I hear a new excuse: “pickup boy is coming by 5 PM,” “it’s raining,” “last slot,” “we’ve escalated,” “refund will be issued soon.”→ NOTHING HAPPENED.And here’s the worst part:THEY HAVE NOT PICKED UP MY PRODUCT AND HAVE NOT REFUNDED MY ₹69,500.THIS IS FRAUD.Even yesterday, a support agent told me the refund will be automatically processed if pickup doesn’t happen — but when I asked her to send this in writing, she REFUSED. Why? Because they know what they’re doing is WRONG.❗ AMAZON IS DEFRAUDING CUSTOMERS. I AM A PRIME MEMBER AND I’VE BEEN HARASSED FOR OVER 1.5 MONTHS.They have wasted my money, time, and trust.This is mental harassment, negligence, and fraudulent conduct.If Amazon can do this for a ₹70,000 iPhone, imagine what they’ll do with smaller purchases. Shameful.📢 I WILL BE POSTING THIS PUBLICLY across all social media platforms, consumer complaint portals, and legal forums. I’m done waiting and being lied to.Order No: 405-2091151-6289112Sold by: Clicktech Retail Pvt. Ltd.Invoice Value: ₹69,500Status: Defective iPhone. Pickup not done. Refund NOT issued.

At least, we know upfront that the guy if earning a small commission at the end of a hard day’s work. We blame the social influences. Come on, let’s take a little responsibility here. No one is holding a gun to our temples. If we opt not to buy, no one else can make us. This Amazon, Temu, Shein - all these are ruining us. Without us ever releasing it.

I immediately attempted to initiate a return through the app, but it did not allow me to proceed. I then contacted customer care, who raised a complaint on my behalf and advised me to get in touch again on 24 June 2025.However, on 24 June, I received a disappointing email stating that the investigation concluded the correct item was delivered, and that no refund or replacement could be issued. I strongly disagree with this conclusion.I would like to bring to your attention that I have clear proof of receiving the wrong product. I recorded a video of the parcel being opened in front of the delivery agent, clearly showing the wrong item inside. I am attaching both the video and supporting photos to this email for your reference.I kindly request that you review this evidence and conduct a further investigation. I am a regular and loyal Amazon customer, and I hope you will treat this issue with the seriousness it deserves.Requested Action: Please review the attached proof and issue a refund or arrange a replacement at the earliest.Looking forward to a prompt and fair resolution.Warm regards,Payal Saini",,2025-07-03T09:06:55.000Z

Trustpilot,I have mixed opinion now,"I always benefitted from Amazon India. Many products that are not available in local market are available on Amazon and I also liked the Prime membership. It's worth spending money to get the products delivered relatively earlier than non-prime members.However now I am deeply disappointed by the addition of Marketplace fee. It seems Amazon has become too greedy now. Such charges are meaningless and Amazon should withdraw such charges.Now I have decided that I will buy from Amazon India only if the item is not available in the local market.I might as well cancel my prime membership.Amazon should reconsider their decision about charging marketplace fee which is small but not refundable.The argument made by Amazon to justify such fee is meaningless. It's their responsibility to bring and show right products to customers in an online shopping business.One more point I want to bring out here is that the Amazon agents literally lie to customers to get 5 star rating. There are many instances where after subsequent chats with customer care I realized that the earlier agent simply told me fake promises. They did nothing in the system, just faked that we will process your refund in 24 hours and fake assurance that I take full responsibility for this issue and I will ensure that it never happens again and all that flattery.Another thing - The biggest seller Clicktech Retail Pvt Ltd is all time cheater. Be careful while buying from them. I was dearly deceived by them. I eventually got my refund from amazon but experience was bitter.Thanks for reading. This is my genuine experience and info sharing.",,2025-06-27T06:21:47.000Z
Trustpilot,Marketplace fee is a scam,"Was a very loyal customer of Amazon Now the newly added marketplace fee of rs 5 per transaction has made me rethink of buying stuff off Amazon anymore Local shops are way better at this point Amazon shouldn’t be so greedy They are already charging the seller for displaying their products which is indirectly borne by the customer They are also charging membership fee from the buyer In addition to that, every transaction attracts a charge of Rs 5 On a single day I’ve paid 15 rs additional So imagine the amount I’ll be paying extra during the course of a year !!! How much more will they burden their customers ???????

Trustpilot,Amazon is a cheat.,Hi this is to inform all consumers that I have been cheated by Amazon. On the 9th of May 2025 I placed an order for Canon printer model E-470 costing me Rs. 5499. Amazon shipped me a printer with Model No. MG-2577S costing Rs. 3099. Both look the same. The invoice bears model E-470. In one month the printer is bad and not functioning. I complained to Canon with the Serial number and Invoice that it is under warranty and needs to be registered first. Canon cannot register as the serial number does not match with the model number mentioned in the invoice. Amazon shipped one inferior cheaper item and mentioned superior one on the invoice. Hence being under warranty I cannot even register as it does not match the invoice and Amazon not willing to provide me correct invoice nor the difference as they claim the window is closed for the refund or exchange. Kindly suggest what do I do.,,2025-06-19T13:46:03.000Z

I had to call customer care 3-4 times for the delivery reattempt. Then on Tuesday, the delivery agent called at around 8:45 pm and marked the order as undeliverable. Immediately I called customer care to inform them about this and asked for delivery between 9am and 6pm, but soon after a few minutes, the order was marked as undeliverable and is returned to the seller. waiting for 1 week for the order and returning to seller due to delivery agent negligence.",,2025-06-17T21:08:53.000Z

Trustpilot,On 2nd May,"On 1st May 2025, I placed an IPhone order on Amazon India at around 10:30 pm . Ship To location - Bangalore Hulimavu, pin 560076. I chose Amazon as it was providing same day delivery, it was very important that I set up the phone during weekend, weekdays there is hardly any time to set up the phone with apps etc. I was exchanging my old iPhone. Immediately after placing the order, basis of email instructions received from Amazon, I did a reset of the phone deleting data and apps which are my lifeline. I dint expect what was next to come. Waited patiently till 6 pm, the tracking number showed package has reached the final hub at 3:46 pm but didn’t show out for delivery or any estimated time by when the package will be delivered. So now I have no food app on the phone to order food, all social media including Wapp is deleted as I formatted the phone, I am at home patiently waiting for the Amazon delivery person to come. I spent almost 20 mints plus to find the Amazon Cust service chat option (mini treasure hunt), chatted with them and clearly mentioned my frustration for not having any information about the delivery time. I insisted that the Customer Service rep talk to the shipping team to get exact information, but the rep only assured me that the delivery will be received by 8:00 pm IST. So I waited till 7:45 pm IST, but there is still no update on Amazon website. So now I called Amazon Cust service. Clearly the rep started giving some generic reply, without any actual effort to find out why the delivery is delayed. I insisted to speak to a supervisor, yet this attempt was also useless. There was no sense of urgency but generic reply that the cutoff window is 10:00 PM IST, i should wait until then. Here also in spite of insisting that the Cust service team speak to shipping to get exact status, the answer was negative, that Cust service doesn’t contact shipping, then can only raise an expedite request. Finally the delivery dint come, website is now showing delivery on 3rd May, a day after. No explanation given on why it was not delivered and why they need 2 more days to deliver when the status shows the packagae has received the final delivery point.Bottom line, pathetic and useless customer service. They didn’t take any real step to ensure package is delivered, instead gave generic assurance that delivery will happen on time. I also doubt their Business tactics, I have been an Amazon customer for several years. Offset I can see a trend of issues related to high value prepaid orders. Buying a few hundred rupees product is fine but I will recommend to not but high value products, especially prepaid from Amazon. They are 100% non-reliable.",,2025-06-02T00:11:11.000Z

Trustpilot,Disappointing Experience,"I purchased the Joyalukkas 22k Yellow Gold Charm Bracelet for my daughter's birthday (Order ID: IQ17H4B365826Q4417), and I'm deeply disappointed with the overall experience.The GoodThe bracelet itself is well-crafted and has a nice, classic design. The 22k gold quality is evident, and it appears to be a durable piece of jewelry.The BadUnfortunately, the issues I faced with this purchase far outweigh the positives. The main problems I encountered were:Unresponsive Seller: After receiving the item and finding it unsuitable, I initiated the return process as per Amazon's instructions. I provided the return address of Joyalukkas India Pvt Ltd and sent the item via Delhivery (AWB: 2827762441325). However, the seller refused to accept the parcel, despite my continuous efforts to reach out to them.Unfair A-Z Guarantee Claim: I then raised an A-Z Guarantee claim with Amazon, but the claim was unfairly closed, stating that I was unresponsive, even though I was actively following up. The tracking details clearly showed that the item was delivered, but the seller was uncooperative.Lack of Support from Amazon: As the marketplace platform, Amazon should have taken more ownership of this issue and helped resolve it, instead of repeatedly asking me to follow up with the unresponsive seller. The lack of support from both Amazon and the seller has left me without the item and without a refund, which is unacceptable.The UglyThe entire experience with this purchase (Order ID: IQ17H4B365826Q4417) has been extremely frustrating and disappointing. I expected better service and support, especially from a reputable brand like Joyalukkas and a platform like Amazon. Unfortunately, this has left a sour taste, and I cannot recommend this product or the seller to anyone.I urge Amazon and Joyalukkas to investigate this issue and take appropriate actions to ensure that customers like myself receive a satisfactory resolution. Until then, I will be hesitant to purchase from either of them in the future.",,2025-05-20T23:54:47.000Z

Trustpilot,Dear Amazon India Customer Experience…,"Dear Amazon India Customer Experience Team,I am writing to express my deep frustration and disappointment with the handling of a return and refund request for an order placed in January 2025. Despite numerous attempts to resolve the matter through your app’s customer service chat, I have received no meaningful support and have been left with no product and no refund.I had ordered a maroon sleeping bag, but received the wrong color (yellow). I returned the item in good faith, expecting either a refund or the correct product in return. Instead, I was told that the product might have been “lost in transit.” However, the app now states that the investigation concluded with Amazon receiving an incorrect item from my end — which is simply not true.To be absolutely clear:	•	I returned the exact item you delivered, only in the wrong color, as per your own error.	•	The pickup agent scanned the item before taking it — which confirms your systems accepted the return.	•	Now, you have my item and my money, and I have nothing.	•	Worst of all, there is no clarity on what Amazon claims it received, and no willingness to provide a resolution.Over the past few months, I’ve repeatedly contacted your support team, including agents named Ajay(spoke on 9th of May 7am, he was very and disconnected the call), Sneha, and Bhagyashree(didn’t wanted to listen at all, I had to ask permission if I can speak. What a customer service!). My experience has been incredibly frustrating — ranging from unhelpful responses to rude behavior and even disconnected calls and chats when I asked to speak to a senior representative. I was abroad for three months and unable to call, so I used the in-app messaging to resolve this — again, with no success.I now demand the following:	1.	A clear explanation of what Amazon received from my return.	2.	Immediate refund of my payment, or return of the product if you claim it’s not eligible for a refund.	3.	A formal apology for the poor handling of this issue, the repeated dismissals, and the unprofessional behavior of your support team.This situation is not just about a monetary refund anymore — it’s a serious concern about how Amazon India treats its customers. The lack of accountability, transparency, and empathy I’ve encountered is beyond unacceptable for a company of your scale.Product - Hacer HC-1500 3in1 Camping Sleeping Bag Open Comforter & Mattress +2 Degree Winter210T Polyester Lining Hiking Trekking Bags for Baby, Adults Men & Women (7ft, Maroon & Grey, 2°C to +5°C, 1.6kg)",,2025-05-09T06:04:31.000Z

I’ve seen bad service before, but this takes the crown for sheer incompetence and apathy. Your over-reliance on automation is not just frustrating—it’s insulting.I had a defective product, and instead of getting help, I got a chatbot playing a never-ending game of “click this” and “try that.” Guess what? None of it worked! Trying to reach a human being felt like attempting to summit Everest blindfolded. After hours—yes, HOURS—of jumping through hoops, I finally managed to get through to a person, and that’s when the real nightmare began.Your refund and replacement policy is an absolute joke. Why am I required to return a defective product first, wait for some mystical “evaluation process,” and then hope for a refund or replacement? Meanwhile, I’m stuck without the item I needed urgently. Where’s the accountability? Where’s the customer-first approach you love to brag about?Here’s the truth: your system is broken. Automation is not a solution if it lacks empathy and flexibility. Your processes are designed to frustrate, delay, and drive customers insane. Do you think people have endless time to deal with your labyrinth of incompetence?Get your act together, Amazon. Ditch the robotic nonsense, fix your policies, and bring in actual humans who know how to solve problems. Until then, you’ve lost a once-loyal customer.

Trustpilot,"Excellent Selection and Service, but Room for Improvement","Amazon offers an extensive range of products, competitive pricing, and efficient delivery, making it a preferred online shopping destination. The user-friendly interface and reliable customer service enhance the overall experience.​However, there are occasional issues with product quality and packaging. Some items received have not met expectations, and packaging can sometimes be inadequate, leading to potential damage during transit.​If Amazon can address these concerns by enhancing quality control and improving packaging standards, it would further solidify its position as a top-tier online retailer.",,2025-04-02T15:01:46.000Z
Trustpilot,Ghastly logistics management & customer service,"Amazon's logistics process has undergone some change and unfortunately not for the better. I had 2 issues with my recent orders. 1. Item was updated as Delivered and not delivered.Tracking ID - has lost meaning - there is no courier contact or POD details. It is impossible to track the item that is pending delivery or reach the delivery agent. The customer service team keeps giving a landline number which keeps playing pre recorded messages - and then disconnects the call saying the person you are calling is unreachable. There is no call to the recipient to confirm time of delivery.The customer service representatives are very polite and quick to apologize but totally unprepared or unable to resolve any issues. Another order made from my wife's account: we had requested for delivery on 26th March and updated delivery instructions to state clearly delivery should be between 10AM to 6PM. The delivery agent attempted delivery on 26th March at 10PM and then said will try next day. Again on 27th March they did tried to deliver at 10PM, my wife spent 30 minutes with customer service representative and was assured the delivery would take place on 28th March. On 28th March we saw you had updated the order as Cancelled and cancellation reason was updated as ""rejected by recipient"". The customer service team again had no idea who has updated this and why. Needless to say the changes they have made to the logistics process are terrible and end customer experience is despicable. I will definitely think twice before ordering anything on Amazon India going forward. It might be cost effective to have disjointed processes, but when they do not run together and the left hand does not know what the right is doing, it is a recipe for disaster.",,2025-03-28T15:53:42.000Z

Trustpilot,I haAmazon India On the Path of Failureve been using a big user of Amazon…,"I have been using a big user of Amazon Online Shopping  since its inception.Recently in last 6 months have been noticing their change in policies and also how much they have lost focus on users.Previously I always felt Amazon online shopping is very safe and convenient and had the feeling that they are always their to address any issues with only purchase and delivery.Around 6 months back I noticed that they started shipping products just by pasting a sticker with order details on the original packing of the order. I was concerned due to 2 reasons. 1. Privacy of what I am buying 2. Safety, I do order expensive items and if it comes that way they it might attract unwanted attention.Some orders still come in box and many with just a sticker attached.Recently I ordered a silver coin which I wanted to gift to someone near.Order got delivered post I gave OTP, delivery person left. I opened the package and to my shock it was a pack of ACV Moringa !There was no bill attached to the package. I am not sure whether they delivered with a sticker bill on the product or sent it inside a cover. Somewhere a mistake has happened, either they shipped the wrong product or someone in the complete package and delivery line has lifted the product and replaced with something different. Reason for my suspicion is they was no original bill attached to the package which said silver coin or ACV Moringa.I contacted Amazon on this, like usually they said don't worry we will resolve.They said they have raised an internal investigation and it will take 5 working days and asked me to contact post that and they will tell me resolution.When I contacted them back post this waiting period they said they have delivered what I ordered ! and they refused to share any further information or evidence which shows that they delivered silver coin.Now I am at loss, as I cannot go legal as it involves cost and I have opened the package. My only evidence is what I have online and chat history. There is no good way I can prove that I was not delivered silver coin and Amazon also is not sharing ANYTHING from there side like a photo which shows silver coin packed. Now conclusion looks like we delivered what you ordered which implies I am lying, which I am not.Saddest past is they are not sharing any part of investigation so that at least I can know where and what went wrong.I have lost complete trust now to order anything expensive and may be will limit my shopping to only cheap items.Posting this as a WARNING MESSAGE to all who order lot of expensive items like Phones, TVs, jewellery, silver and what not ...Please think twice before you order in Amazon India. Not just their empathy but their credibility too has gone down significantly.WARNING Again, just be careful with what you order. Even if you ask delivery associate to stop and open infront of him not sure how much its going to help. So is the video recording if you do before opening.As for me, I will limit my expensive online purchases.",,2025-02-16T08:35:04.000Z

However, when the same thing happened with my other orders, I called customer support again. This time, the representative put me on hold, saying she was checking the details—but she never came back! I waited 19 minutes before hanging up.This experience has completely shattered my trust in Amazon India. The delivery personnel are falsely marking orders as rejected, and customer support is either misinformed or outright unhelpful.

Counterfeit and low-quality items are everywhere, and Amazon doesn’t seem to care about filtering out fake sellers. I have received defective products multiple times, and returning them is another headache—pickup gets delayed indefinitely, and they always try to find an excuse to reject the return.Oh, and their so-called ""deals"" and ""sales"" are a scam! Prices are inflated before a sale, and the discounts are fake. I’d rather buy from local stores than deal with this nonsense.If you want frustration, delays, and disappointment, shop at Amazon India.

Trustpilot,Horrible customer service and reliability,"I am a Prime member. Amazon India has horrible customer service and reliability. I ordered a product on Jan 18. The product was sold by third-party seller but fulfilled by Amazon. That means when the order is received, it is packed and shipped from Amazon. My order was for 2 units. But Amazon shipped me only 1 item.When I called the customer service this was my experience.a. The customer support blamed me for the mistake done by Amazon. She said the problem was due to me and she can treat it as a regular return and refund. She initially told me I would have to ship the item back to them on my own. After much argument, she agreed for item to be picked up from Amazon.b. I have had to call Amazon customer support 3 times and item has not been picked up not refund has been issued.c. The customer support rep after the 3 time calling, refused directly that she will not allow me to talk to a supervisor or manager. She would not give me her name for giving feedbackd. She refused to provide customer case number to follow-up on the case.e. After wasting 30 minutes not resolving my issue, she had the audacity to tell me that I have wasted 30 mins of her time.All I wanted is for the mistake done by Amazon to be fixed and It's been 10 days and 3 times calling customer support and issue has not been resolved.

Trustpilot,Indian government must take action against Amazon.in,"I have used Amazon services in India, the UAE, and the UK, and it’s clear that Amazon’s customer service depends heavily on the consumer protection laws in each country. Unfortunately, Amazon India (AmazonIn) provides the worst service, which seems linked to the weaker customer protection laws in India. Instead of improving delivery and customer support, AmazonIn focuses on manipulating its performance metrics (KPIs), often at the expense of customer satisfaction.Recently, I ordered a kids’ play pool for my toddler during a short vacation. The item reached a delivery hub just 5 kilometres from my house, in a suburban area, on a Friday. However, Friday deliveries are often marked as ""customer unreachable,"" even when they aren’t. This tactic delays the delivery and allows Amazon to avoid immediate accountability. When I contacted Amazon, they refused to deliver the item from the nearby hub and instead offered to send a replacement from a hub over 1,000 kilometres away. Frustrated by the delay, I cancelled the order and chose a different product.The second item, which had a two-day Prime delivery promise, faced more issues. It was delayed at a main hub and then cancelled entirely before reaching the local hub. Amazon’s only solution was to send another replacement at their convenience, leaving me even more frustrated.These experiences show that Amazon*In focuses more on managing internal targets than solving customer problems. With no strong consumer protection laws in India, the company faces little accountability and continues to test customer patience and loyalty. Until stronger laws are introduced, customers in India will keep facing these issues.",,2024-12-20T06:35:25.000Z

We bought a portable kettle which - after the return period - started to rust. They don't refund the money for an object that is for food use and is a HEALTH ISSUE! For them it is not valid and they only base it on the answer ‘it is out of time for return’ but what are we talking about? They do not understand anything. They only follow protocol, they are like machines and they are not professionals to go to the problem and understand it to the bottom and be able to help. They tell me to contact the seller. They also don't understand that I have bought from Amazon India and I have NOT bought directly from the seller, so it is Amazon India that has to help and PONDER SOLUTION, even report for selling a product with health risk.!!!!!!!!!",,2024-12-17T08:29:13.000Z
Trustpilot,Wrost Experience,"Wrost Experience I had an extremely frustrating experience with Amazon India. My order is now 6 days late, and when I contacted customer support, I was told to wait another 7 days, which seems ridiculous. Every time I reached out, I was given different answers and passed around to multiple representatives. One agent, Viswajeeth, made a false promise that my order would be delivered on Saturday, but it never arrived. Then, another representative, Ruchita, claimed that the product had been damaged, even though I’d been waiting for 15 days. This response is absurd and feels like harassment.It’s clear that Amazon India has a serious lack of customer service knowledge, with some agents not even understanding English properly. I feel like I’m being lied to, and I’m not the only one—many others must be going through the same frustrating experience. Now, after all this time, they’re offering a refund and claiming they don’t have my parcel. This entire situation has been incredibly disheartening. I would not recommend shopping on Amazon India based on this experience.",,2024-12-16T07:40:19.000Z
Trustpilot,Amazon has started thugging,I was just reading the reviews on Amazon customer service. Sad that I didn't do it before ordering a lot of products. I've had a horrible experience as well. I ordered a book. I got a message that it has been delivered in the 7th of December '24. I didn't receive it. I tried putting it up on the reviews but got no response. I then called and got assured that the matter would be investigated and I'll get a solution in 48hrs. When I called after 48 hrs I spoke to Anushka who said it won't be possible to get a solution before 4 days of the complaint being registered. I insisted on being connected to a more responsible person and she put me on to Daisy who rudely just disconnected the phone after telling me that there's no way I could be helped. I then chatted with Harsheel who gave me the same reply and just disconnected the chat. I was desperate and called once again. This time Amol convinced me that I would get a solution surely by the 15th. I waited patiently and chatted today. I was told that I need to raise a fresh complaint since my phone was switched off when the investigation department called me. He then told me that I would now expect a solution only after the 20th. I then called and was told that I was speaking to a Amazon specialist. She also told me that I would get a solution only after the 20th.,,2024-12-15T11:20:49.000Z

Trustpilot,Wrong and defective furniture products,"So far it's quite good and I enjoyed shopping on Amazon for quite a long time. I used to give high rating in terms of product range, quality of products, and most importantly the delivery speed and customer service.Recently I ordered some furniture items like TV Cabinet, King Size Bed, Dining Chairs, Shoe Shelf, and a coffee table through various different orders starting from August 2024 to till date. And almost all the above mentioned items I received were either different, defective, and damaged. I have shared my concern with Amazon to monitor the sellers and take necessary action and insist sellers to send exact products as shown in the order description and image without any defects or damages. But no action was taken and my latest order of a coffee table turned out to be an entirely different one which was of no use in any way. Moreover, getting replacement has become a cumbersome process. I am still struggling to return it even a week after it's delivery. And now I came to know now that there is no replacement available with the seller and I have to return it and get the refund.All the above clearly demonstrates that some sellers particularly those who sell furniture on Amazon have become so untrustworthy that I have decided to stop ordering for furniture products on Amazon.Its more unfortunate that Amazon also not initiating any steps to ensure that correct and undefective products without any damages are being sent by the furniture sellers.I sincerely hope that the furniture sellers on Amazon also will stop dumping wrong and defective products on customers without checking in future.Amazon also need to devise a system wherein the sellers should send exact products as ordered and as shown and described without any deviation. Any complaint from the customers with regard to wrong product or defective product need to be viewed seriously and action in the form of penalty should be taken against the particular seller. Then only this kind of incidents can be controlled in future.",,2024-12-11T09:31:35.000Z

The product had already been used in more than 10 devices leading to it being blocked from registration and use in further devices. Amazon and seller Clicktech Retail refused to refund or replace the item when I tried to initiate a return. Pathetic amazon customer service said they are first going to investigate until the last day of the return period and I should call them back after that if I need to return it.

I emailed them but only received automated responses and the app would not load the online chat page.Customer service is a sham. They come across as sadistic! On one single live chat I was transferred to 7 different representatives and they were still not able to locate my orders. I requested for pictures confirming the delivery location, but was denied that too.I was given a Complaint Id but on follow up after a few days as instructed, was told the number did not exist. On my third attempt at contacting customer service via chat again, the representative was disgustingly patronising. Confirmed a refund in the chat and an email, promising the amount would be refunded within 4 hours. It's been 2 days with no refund in my wallet yet. I also emailed the Pay Grievances team but again was directed to Customer Service....twice.Such shame that Amazon India brings to an otherwise internationally reputed and reliable shopping experience.",,2024-11-05T07:45:15.000Z
Trustpilot,Indian consumers are fool for Amazon,Amazon considers Indian consumers as fools. Here they can sell anything to anyone in name of anything. I ordered berberine thorne from there platform and received capsules filled with turmeric. I complained on product but they rejected my issue. I read many reviews by foreign clients with same feedback and they have considered and refunded them but not Indian clients  now I ordered berberine from iherb and we can clearly see the difference in capsules. I want to post pic of both capsules but here there is no option.,,2024-10-30T10:31:13.000Z
Trustpilot,Amazon continues to disappoint,"Amazon continues to disappoint. It claims to be a customer-centric company, built on customer reviews, but my experience shows otherwise. In my case, I’ve lost nearly 5,000 due to unknown charges and a refusal to issue a refund. They say it’s because I didn’t return the item correctly, but I did my best to work with the seller, who has not responded, likely because Amazon advised them not to. This has become a clear case of fraud, where Amazon’s support team offers only scripted responses without genuine help. When I tried to return my items, I was met with repeated refusals and excuses.If you’re buying from Amazon, please don’t go in blindly. I advise everyone to keep proof of all transactions, take screenshots of emails, and document every step if you return something—even a video of the return process. Amazon’s escalation team lacks basic courtesy and flexibility, sticking to one script rather than actually helping. Despite all my documented evidence, they still refuse to refund me.I urge others to be cautious and support this message so we can work together to hold Amazon accountable. If you’ve had similar experiences, let’s unite to bring attention to these issues.",,2024-10-26T08:51:42.000Z

It was picked up on 29th September 2024 and since then I've been chasing them for refund.They have issued a Cheque to me without my consent with the incorrect account name.I've been continuously requesting for the refund in my bank account but they're are continuously lying about it. One of the customer service agents had given me a fake promise about the refund that it will be credited to your bank account in 3-5 days on 15th October 2024. Today is 24th October and I've called them complaining about the same thing to which they replied that the cheque was cancelled by you so you have to wait 14 days and then we will call you for the next process.This is so much annoying and frustrating.I have asked them to provide this thing in writing to which they've denied.Now I have to rely on them for the amount of INR 15,490/-I would never ever recommend Amazon.in to any of my friends and family. Pathetic Customer service.Shame on you Amazon.inP.S. - I have all the screenshots of their false promises from the Amazon message centre and also Amazon.in must be having the call recordings.

Trustpilot,Amazon India Delivery is horrible,"I have been a customer of Amazon India for quite a few years now. I live abroad and usually place orders before my arrival. My delivery destination is Panaji-Goa. In the past, I have had a couple of problems with deliveries which were reported to your customer service and refund issued but they were minor compared to other one I just had to go through.I have had a very nasty experience with your service for the orders I placed in August and September of 2024.Following are the dates with order amounts:10/08/24 – Rs 3,793.3526/08/24 – Rs 5,645.0002/09/24 – Rs 19,382.0006/09/24 – Rs 3,149.25Just so you know, this totals to Rs 31,969.60 of which I received a refund of Rs 18,037. This amounts to a staggering 56%.Only one order of Rs 2,450 was a result of Seller not being able to source the product I ordered while the rest of them were because the final delivery could not be made. This puts down the Refund % due to Amazon Initiated Returns at 53%.All of the refunds are shown as RETURNS by Customer while in reality it is because your staff was not able to make the final delivery. I was in constant touch with your customer service and each time they told me that the item has been damaged during shipment. I don’t think this is true because your excellent tracking system shows the item was received at final distribution location in PANAJI-GOA. I cant believe that someone in customer service hasn’t noticed that 53% of my orders were as a result of Returns Initiated by Amazon. With so many of my orders being returned by your delivery staff, I feel that I was being selectively targeted. I don’t know anyone who works at Amazon India, let alone at the distribution center in Panaji-Goa so I cannot understand why I was being targeted.Regards",,2024-10-19T20:19:29.000Z

Trustpilot,Amazon.in New Trend to Scam Customers,"Amazon has started a new business trend with their 1 replacement policy 1. According to Amazon, a product will only be replaced once after which product will be returned and money refunded to customer2. Merchants taking advantage of this loophole by being lazy with their product pricing, accuracy of descriptions etc. and wait till customers make a purchase3. Upon making a purchase on Amazon, merchants will then change anywhere from just product pricing/descriptions to the entire product itself and then send faulty/wrong product to customer despite their order billing being different 4. Customer will now order replacement which will also be another faulty product and since only 1 replacement, customer is now forced to return/refund 5. Merchants can now force customer to wait exhorbitant times between replacements and refund (that way some customers will opt to keep damaged/wrong product) and/or buy same product for new higher priceI spent 1 month trying to buy a frying pan with issues like above. Biggest companies like Hawkins, Milton doing this while entire category has misleading info in them. Similar issue when I tried to buy a pedestal FanThey even reject a replacement product for pedestal fan halfway through delivery (or after claiming its out for delivery) and claim customer rejected it. Speaking to their Team leader (call escalation), they claim since it was rejected, I can only get refund. Nice Scamming by Amazon India. Very aggressive team leader making accusations that customer making legal accusations etc. when confronted with prior frying pan evidence.READ Amazon Reviews before buying. Almost every big product has 1 or 2 review talking about fake delivery and rejections claiming customer did it etc. If you see such comments, try to avoid purchasing those product categories from Amazon.",,2024-10-24T04:05:53.000Z

Trustpilot,Pathetic service.,"I was recently delivered a defective one plus 12R that won't even turn on and Amazon has entirely shirked their responsibility. They washed their hands off claiming it's a One plus issue, and I need to deal this directly with the manufacturer. They won't let you return/replace it or take any action for that matter. Apparently, it's mentioned in their policy that Amazon is not responsible for defective products even if it arrives Dead. Well, that gives a customer much confidence to shop on Amazon.If you’re lucky enough like me, to get that faulty device, brace yourself for a nightmare. Be prepared to be put on hold for hours and hours, transferred through never ending loops of mind games, bad attitudes and utmost unprofessional behaviour of the Amazon staff.. ranging from their agents to technicians to so called mangers. This ridiculous drama will drag on for days, driving you to the brink of insanity - forcing you to either give up or become one of them... Insane! I chose the former and now find myself with a non-working phone, a loss of 45k INR, and just a sliver of sanity left!To be honest, I’ve always bought all my phones and gadgets from Amazon. However, I feel compelled to write this not just because of a one-off bad experience, but because I’ve realized that this is a widespread issue. Countless others have faced this nightmare, particularly during a ""SALE"". Good luck with shopping on Amazon guys!",,2024-10-17T11:23:36.000Z
Trustpilot,"AMAZON IS FRAUD AND SCAM, NEVER EVER TRUST AMAZON. IT ONLY SALE DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.","I purchased a TCL 55 INCH Qled tv C61B for 38990 Rupees from Amazon on 12/09/2024 mode of payment was Amazon pay balance. I took a loan from snapmint at a high interest rate to purchase this tv. I got TV delivery on 14/09/2024, i find that this TV was defective. It is having  an problem in Grey scale uniformity and also while playing Netflix there is a lines on upper black strip and a scar on upper right corner display. I raised a complaint to Amazon on 16/09/2024 for this issue. On 20/09/2024 Technician from TCL company visited at my home and he find this problem in my TCL TV too. On 23/09/2024 i raised complaint in Amazon for return pickup before the return pickup window closes on 24/09/2024, and Amazon initiated My TV Return pickup for 28/09/2024, but no one from Amazon came to pick up the TV. The next day Amazon updated the wrong notification in the App that the return pickup was cancelled by the customer. Lying and wrong update from Amazon. Now again the same problem i face several times  the dates mentioned below for the return pickup of my defective TV by Amazon:-03/10/2024 return pickup -05/10/2024 return pickup -07/10/2024 return pickup I'm having the call recordings of these mentioned dates, and relevant screenshots too.On 03/10/2024  my TCL TV was assigned for Return pickup and not for replacement, but on that same day delivery person from direct TCL Company came with the replacement TCL TV but at the same time infront of the delivery person from TCL COMPANY I called Amazon and confirmed that this replacement was not assigned by Amazon because as per my Communication with Amazon excutive he said me not to receive this replacement TCL TV, because my TV was assigned for the return pickup by only Amazon employee, so I didn't take that replacement TCL TV from the delivery person of TCL company. I'm having the cctv footage of it.And again Amazon updated wrong notification that customer cancelled Return pickup and making me fool. I never cancelled the Return pickup of defective TCL TV. Now finally Amazon said me that that will do the investigation. Why was the Return Pickup not done by Amazon pickup person and they will update me on 10/10/2024 with their resolution. Now I called Amazon today, and they updated me that they will not Return refund or replacement of the TV and they cannot do anything, because in their fake and wrong investigation, Amazon  blamed on me that the return  update.I made so many calls to Amazon customer care and the several calls made by me with call duration time was 20-40 minutes also, and Amazon wasted my time and using my hard earned money by falsely blaming on me for the Return Pickup cancel.Amazon did mentally harassment to me and wasted my time by several times promising falsely me to return  pickup of my TCL TV. Amazon Wasted my time and inconvenience and distressed and made me frustrated by my financial loss.Kindly help me to Return my TV and get me the refund and I need the compensation from Amazon for mentally harrasment, frustration, and distress , my financial loss and wasted my time.

Trustpilot,Customer care has started to threaten now.,"Amazon used to be my favorite app to order from, not just because of the products, but also because of the app design, delivery process, and customer service. However, it has been getting worse day by day. Delivery personnel now drop off your product with anyone in your society without informing or calling you, and sometimes they mark it as delivered without actually delivering the product.When you call customer service, they offer countless excuses, such as “We are just a platform, the delivery team is separate,” or “It was done by mistake,” or “It happened automatically”—endless, nonsensical excuses. Now, they’ve even started threatening to escalate the conversation, though it’s unclear to whom.After paying for a product, we expect a smooth transaction, but instead, we get delayed deliveries, poor communication, and rude customer service that gives threats. Amazon seems to have forgotten that it’s the customers who keep the app going.",,2024-10-07T08:27:58.000Z

Trustpilot,It is risky to buy a product from…,"It is risky to buy a product from Amazon India as platform doesn't check the authenticity of description/advertisement published by vendor in Amazon platform. The vendors describe wrong information to tell their products are superior than other vendors but its not in actual. Recently I ordered a smart watch IZI brand from Amazon Order no. # 402-8871612-0399531where vendor mentioned the product first launch date is 28 January'24 but the item delivered by Amazon it was mentioned imported in Oct'22, how its possible? Under review of this item made by customers is negative due to malfunctioning of sensors and slow response. Considering that the product launched in Jan'24 is improved and issues were addressed earlier noticed, I ordered this product. I have made 3 times complaints in Amazon for return of the item in platform & talked to representatives of Amazon but no result. Also, when I gave negative feedback of this item and Amazon platform, they didn't publish my feedback under review of this product.",,2024-10-01T08:49:36.000Z

Trustpilot,"Pathetic Return Policy, Non-existent Support","Both their support and service has gone downhill. I purchased a blue colored jeans pant recently. They sent black color pant. So, I returned it. Now it is almost a month, it is still in return, and my money is stuck with them. They have introduced to refund after the product is back to the seller, and made the return so slow, so that they can encash with customers' money. The support? There is no support. They had a chat system a few months ago, where one could contact support team and talk about issues. They have completely replaced the chat with chatbot. There is no way to contact them.They have high price, careless delivery, terrible return, and pathetic non-existent support. They are like they are in the market to give pain to the customers. They have forgotten that in India, there is local market where people can visit and buy, and have far better experience and support from the seller.Bye Amazon. You have permanently lost a customer of 12 years!",,2024-09-27T05:19:32.000Z

Trustpilot,Worst experience ever faced with an…,"Worst experience ever faced with an online shopping site.If there was an option even to give a less than 1 star I would have rated them as zero.I had ordered an item through Amazon on 03 th September through Amazon india and it was supposed to be delivered by 6th September.Everyday from 6th I have been receiving otps for the delivery person to deliver the item,but none of the executives have called till date ie.for the last 9 days and from then I have been chatting with their executives and the case has been transferred to their sensitive team atleast after 6-7 persons assurance that it will reach.Suddenly last 3 days back sensitive team assured me that it will reach the next day as the package was damaged earlier and now the item is damaged and it would be replaced by a fresh one and will be dispatched directly from the sellers side.Amazon has been misleading me for the last 9 days and then when I contacted the seller directly they said Amazon has not sent the item back nor have come up with an issue of damage.I had ordered the item for onam celebration as a gift for my loved ones and they spoiled the occasion through their horrible conversations and false promises.If Amazon doesn't want to deliver the orders please stop accepting orders,false promises to customers can't be allowed.Please change the perspective or keep staffs who can serve customers better.",,2024-09-14T10:37:30.000Z
Trustpilot,AMAZON IS FRAUD,"I order airpods pro (2nd generation) on 3rd September and my order was supposed to be delivered on 09th September. On 09th Sept I did not receive a delivery message that my order was out for delivery, after speaking to the customer care executive asking for the delivery agent contact details and OTP to receive the parcel they emailed me. I called the agent but to no avail as he kept disconnecting my calls, and he called me at 10:45pm in the night to which I couldn't answer as I was asleep. Firstly, I would like to highlight that the address provided by me was a commercial address which ideally the delivery time should have been before 7pm  but on the app it was mentioned before 10pm. Furthermore, on 10th September no delivery agent was assigned to my parcel, after chatting with around 7 customer service agents and the local Amazon delivery station they conveyed that my order would receive before 7pm today. I waited until 5:30pm and called the customer service frustrated. To my surprise the customer service agent conveyed that no delivery agent has been assigned to the order so it isn't possible to get it delivered by today and by any means we will have to cancel the order and place a new order on the 13th September.

Trustpilot,Do not buy electronic goods on Amazon,"I just realized that buying electronic items from Amazon can be a recipie for disaster.  Luckly for me it was a low cost item, a feature phone from a company called Lava which I bought for mum.  She cannot use smartphones.  The phone withn a month started acting up and now the regular speaker is not working and the latest issue is the phone is not ringing for calls and then all we see are the missed calls.  Contacted Amazon Customer Care and after multiple attempts got the message that they really understand my situation but they cannot help me and I have to contact the brand.  The brand tells me for a phone that is only worth 1500 rupees I have to take it to their service center which is 20 plus kilometers away to drop it off to service center and then repeat the same process again to pick it up. Working out to a full day of productivity lost.  I am going to take it to a local store and try to get it serviced.  Not bothered about the warranty and the sad part is I have been buying extended warranty from Amazon on all electronic stuff.  Just goes to show how much of a sucker you can be when you trust a store.  So a piece of advice, buy other stuff if you get good prices on Amazon but never buy electronic goods.  Your chance of gettng any issues that arise with the product fixed once the return period is over are slime to non existent unless you are willing to go to the trouble of going to the customer care center to deliver the phone and then to pick it up again.  Be aware of this before you buy any electronic goods on Amazon.",,2024-09-05T18:19:37.000Z
